      ITechJump is a technical pre-testing and continuous-learning app focused on
      <strong>senior developers</strong>. It helps you prepare for interviews,
      sharpen your daily coding skills, and grow toward
      <strong>software architect</strong> level over time.

    <h2 class="section-title">What ITechJump Is</h2>
    <p>
      ITechJump is built to cover the key technical areas that can come up
      in a senior-level developer interview—and then keep helping you
      <strong>after you get the job</strong>. Instead of a one-time cram tool,
      it’s designed as an ongoing
      <strong>career education enhancer</strong> and daily question lookup.
    </p>

    <ul class="bullet-list">
      <li>Practice anywhere — mobile or desktop.</li>
      <li>
        Use it as a daily companion for real coding work:
        <strong>Search</strong> for questions, answers, and patterns.
      </li>
      <li>
        Revisit core OOP, design patterns, and modern architecture topics
        as you move toward <strong>Software Architect</strong> roles.
      </li>

          Mobile Testing &amp; Self-Practice
          <span class="pill-tag">On the go</span>
        </h3>
        <p>
          On mobile, you can test yourself anywhere. Each question can be
          delivered as <strong>voice-based Q&amp;A</strong> or
          <strong>multiple choice</strong>, so you can keep practicing even
          when you don’t want to type.
        </p>
        <ul class="mini-list">
          <li>Listen to questions and answers during commutes or breaks.</li>
          <li>Use multiple-choice mode for quick checks and refreshers.</li>
          <li>
            Great for staying sharp on fundamentals and new topics day to day.

          Typed Answers (Test)
          <span class="pill-tag">PC focus</span>
        </h3>
        <p>
          On a PC, the <strong>Test</strong> option focuses on
          <strong>typed answers</strong> — similar to what you’d say in an
          interview, but captured in writing so we can analyze it.
        </p>
        <ul class="mini-list">
          <li>Type responses in your own words, not multiple choice.</li>
          <li>
            ITechJump scans for <strong>key technical keywords</strong> that
            senior engineers and architects expect to hear.
          </li>
          <li>
            When your answer reaches <strong>80%+</strong> of the expected
            keywords, that question is marked <strong>complete</strong>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">
          This trains you to speak like a senior developer: clear,
          keyword-rich explanations that map to real interview expectations.

        </h3>
        <p>
          The <strong>Review</strong> option shows you how your answers evolve
          over time. Every time you answer a question, we track it. Review
          pulls that history together so you can see your growth.

          </li>
          <li>
            Use repetition to lock in key concepts so they come out naturally
