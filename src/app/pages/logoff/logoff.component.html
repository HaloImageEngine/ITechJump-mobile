    </p>

    <ul class="bullet-list">
      <li>
        <strong>Use Search Daily:</strong> Treat ITechJump as your technical
        reference library. Search for any concept when you encounter it in
        real work.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Practice Regularly:</strong> Even 10-15 minutes of daily
        practice helps keep interview skills sharp and concepts fresh.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Review Your Progress:</strong> Check the Scores section to see
        which areas need more attention and track your growth over time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mobile Testing:</strong> Use voice-based questions during
        commutes or breaks to maximize your learning time.
